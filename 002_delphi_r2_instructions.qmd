You will all have this doc and a revisedversion of your response excel sheet[^002_delphi_r2_instructions-1] . Open both, you'll be switching between them a fair amount (Alt + tab switches between windows).

[^002_delphi_r2_instructions-1]: Revisions to your worksheet since round 1:

    -   Herbivore impact sheet: complete revision. Previous responses have had to be thrown out.

    -   Ground flora and tree species richness: now expressed as "percentage of appropriate", rather than number. Your responses from round 2 are still there (for your reference).

    -   Re-scaled value functions to be 0-100 scale, and weightings, so that the most important indicator had a score of 100

    -   Some (largely minor) changes made where it seemed in keeping with your intent. Contact for a chat if you disagree.

You can open this page in a second tab/window on your browser to refer back to it as you go.

If you want, you can re-familiarise yourself with the [project background and scope](001_project%20background.qmd) and the [general approach](01_general%20approach.qmd) through which WEC will be calculated. You should have a general familiarity of how the different indicator value functions and weightings come together to calculate WEC.

# Round 2 value functions

For each indicator:

1.  Open its sheet in the excel book and its page in this book.
2.  Familiarise yourself with the measurement method.
3.  **Compare your response** in round 1 to others in the expert panel.
    -   Also consider the approach of other organisations and the current WT condition assessment (info at the bottom of each page).
4.  **Revise your estimates** in the excel book (you don't need to change them if you don't want to!)
5.  **Revise your certainty**
6.  **New exceptions**/comments/considerations/concerns [in red]{style="color:red;"} please(so we know they are new).
    -   Review the exceptions etc already provided, no real need to double-up on what others have already said (unless you particularly want to put your weight behind them).

## Practice example interactive figure

Have a quick practice with these example interactive figures:

-   Isolate your response: double-click your name in the legend on the right (double click again to reset).

    -   Single click to remove/add individuals of interest.

-   Hover to see who each belongs to, their certainty score and their weighting for this indicator.

    -   Hover also shows the value given at each point: this might be useful to remind yourself what you originally said once you've started changing your responses in the excel sheet.

-   Zoom: click-and-drag (double-click to reset).

-   Some indicators have a "Categorised value function" tab (indicators with a limited number of measurements, e.g. number of tree size classes). This is the same info, but with boxplots showing the average for each category and the spread around them.

-   There are also tabs showing the weightings for each indicator, and comparing that to others. You don't have to worry about that here; the weightings have their [own dedicated page in this book](04_Importance%20weightings.qmd).

```{r vf Tree age size distribution - categorical, echo = F , results="asis"}

#### Weights

```{r vf Tree age size distribution - weights, fig.width= 4, echo = F , results="asis"}

ggplot_resp_weight_ind(indicator_name = indicator_name)

```

#### Standardised weights

```{r std weights, fig.width= 4, echo = F , results="asis"}

ggplot_resp_weight_ind(indicator_name = indicator_name, weight_variable = "weight_standardised")

```

Weights, standardised so that all respondents varied the same amount
:::

### Use the full 0-100 scale (or a flat line)

For comparison everyone needs to be using the same scale. This also keeps the final score on a 0-100 scale, instead of something more arbitrary like a scale of 5-80.

If you want a line that's less steep, adjust that indicator weight to be low (like 10, or 5, maybe even 0 if you think it should have no effect).

![Don't do this, use the whole 0-100 scale](images/use%20full%20scale.png)

### Don't need to use full scale available

Some indicators, particularly the negative indicators (tree health, human damage and invasive cover) had a lot of variation, and some respondents still scored relatively high condition for e.g. 50% invasive cover. Think carefully for these what cover you might really start to worry about, and have a look at the approaches used by others at the bottom of the page for context.

## Round 2 Weightings

When you come to [the weightings page of this book](04_Importance%20weightings.qmd), you will notice that their is a lot of disagreement about which indicators are more/less important for condition. Do your best in these revisions, this is clearly an area we will have to think about carefully. I have tried to provide further information to help you revise your estimates for these. There are tabs that showing:

-   The rank order given to indicators by respondents

-   Standardised weightings: transformed so that each respondent varied the same amount between them (i.e. ignoring that some respondents thought that indicators were all similar/all very different).

Remember: the weighting is multiplied by the value to get that indicator's condition score: higher weightings effectivly mean a steeper line for the value function, lower weightings mean a flatter line.

Make sure that your most important indicator has a score of 100 (so we are all working to the same scale).

Add any new exceptions/comments/considerations/concerns [in red]{style="color:red;"} (so we know they are new)
