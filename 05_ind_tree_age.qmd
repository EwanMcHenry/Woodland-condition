# Tree age distribution

## Justification

More variation in age class increases niche-space, and hence biodiversity[^05_ind_tree_age-1]. Age-class evenness also provides a measure of the presence of continuous regeneration and healthy stand replacement (ecological functioning).

[^05_ind_tree_age-1]: Peter Lowe, Saul Herbert

## Measuring

Check-box of size classes present.

Should be combined with measurement of [regeneration classes](13_regen.qmd), and possibly [veteran trees](11_avts.qmd).

> Alternative 1: Estimated abundance/cover for each size class.
>
> Alternative 2: Measure dbh of all trees in plot (over a given size), allowing e.g. standard deviation to be calculated.

### Suggested size classes:

-   \< 7cm (tin of beans)

-   7 - 30cm (approx. 1 m circumference)
    -   Note very large range, consider splitting [^05_ind_tree_age-2]

-   30 - 60 (approx. 1.9m circumference)

-   60 cm

-   <div>

    > A higher class may be useful[^05_ind_tree_age-3]

    </div>

### Indicator design considerations

This indicator captures age distribution, with more even age distributions ideally showing better condition.

![](images/Tree%20Age%20or%20Size%20Distribution%20value%20function.png)

This age-distribution could be summarised by e.g. a [Shannon diversity index](https://bio.libretexts.org/Sandboxes/tholmberg_at_nwcc.edu/General_Ecology_Ecology/Chapter_22%3A_Biodiversity/22.5%3A_Measuring_Biodiveristy), this would require information on the abundance/cover of trees in each size category.

Where this is not possible the presence/absence of different size categories is a suitable alternative.

Note: Veteran Trees and Regeneration are dealt with in separate indicators (as well).

### Comments on estimates

VFs - consensus likely:

-   All continuous relationships have same shape.

-   Complete agreement on upper and lower value.

-   Some put maximum value at 3 classes.

Weight - very diverse opinions

### Considerations for indicator design

Abundance of different sizes (and their distribution) is important: one dominant class + one slightly older tree this is not the same as a good mix of two age classes[^05_ind_tree_age-4]

[^05_ind_tree_age-4]: Saul Herbert

-   Number of classes alone might mislead, e.g. 3/5 could all be intermediate classes, with no old or young

-   Number of trees in each class would be much more useful than cover (because bigger trees have more cover)

Could measure size class diversity directly, e.g. Record dbh of all trees within plot to calculate standard deviation[^05_ind_tree_age-5]?

[^05_ind_tree_age-5]: Kevin Watts suggests standard deviation of tree dbh as the single most important structural indicator of biodiversity

Individual size classes may have different "Value": consider a score for each individual class present and sum (to a max of 100), with less points for intermediate stages [^05_ind_tree_age-6].

[^05_ind_tree_age-6]: Alasdair Firth

May be difficult to distinguish between more than three age classes, and yet condition could likely improve further[^05_ind_tree_age-7].

[^05_ind_tree_age-7]: Saul Herbert

Dbh not always a reliable indicator of age[^05_ind_tree_age-8]

[^05_ind_tree_age-8]: Richard Brown

### Priority exceptions

Woodland Type

-   Young woodland and woodland creation sites [^05_ind_tree_age-9]

    -   Maybe 2 size classes would be max expected.

    -   Lower importance in young wood[^05_ind_tree_age-10]

-   Wet wood

    -   Good condition at lower number of classes [^05_ind_tree_age-11]

-   Scrub woodland

    -   May be difficult to age e.g. Gorse, bramble[^05_ind_tree_age-12]

-   Montane woodlands[^05_ind_tree_age-13]

-   Upland woods

    -   Wont have more than three, but that would be good[^05_ind_tree_age-14]

-   Wood pasture/ffridd[^05_ind_tree_age-15]

    -   Frequently have only one age class of surviving trees,

        -   But this should represent reduced potential quality[^05_ind_tree_age-16]

    -   Older trees likely to be more permanent[^05_ind_tree_age-17]

        -   Could mean that condition will be easier to sustain on those sites, but not nessesarily "improve" the condition score[^05_ind_tree_age-18]

    -   Scale/number of plots may need to be bigger to represent size classes present[^05_ind_tree_age-19]

-   Coppice[^05_ind_tree_age-20]

    -   Age-diversity may be between coups, rather than within plots

Scale and landscape context[^05_ind_tree_age-21] -

[^05_ind_tree_age-21]: Peter Lowe, Kylie Jones Mattock, Hannah Patterson

-   A variety of even aged stands at different ages may be ok

-   May not vary within plot, but be good across a site or even sub compartment[^05_ind_tree_age-22].

-   Lower importance where landscape has plenty of woodland with diversity of ages[^05_ind_tree_age-23]

### Concerns covered by other indicators

Important lichen stands[^05_ind_tree_age-24]

[^05_ind_tree_age-24]: Kylie Jones Mattock

> If the limitation here is light it may be better captured by other indicators. Not sure why an "age distribution effect on condition" would be have particuarlly important exceptions RE lichens[^05_ind_tree_age-25]

[^05_ind_tree_age-25]: Ewan McHenry

### Lower priority exceptions

Pioneer species often regenerate in even aged cohorts[^05_ind_tree_age-26]

[^05_ind_tree_age-26]: Peter Lowe

> While this may make even-age structure more likely among pioneer species, it does not necessarily mean that the impact of age-structure on condition should be treated differently in that context. If they are all one age, condition is lower.[^05_ind_tree_age-27]

# Other approaches

## Woodland Wildlife Toolkit & NFI

Value score depends on number of classes present, out of three

If tree species is not a birch, cherry or Sorbus

-   0 – 20 years (Young)

-   21 - 150 years (Intermediate)

\>150 years (Old)

For birch, cherry or Sorbus species: 0 - 20 years (Young) , 21 - 60 years (Intermediate) and \>60 years (Old)

## Current WT estate condition assessment

Records DAFOR for 5 age categories: \<20 yo;  20-50; 50-100, 100-200, veteran - Note: what exactly DAFOR means for veterans is unclear

> Note: DOMIN scale would be preferred over DAFOR.
