# Tree age distribution

## Justification

More variation in age class increases niche-space, and hence biodiversity[^05_ind_tree_age-1]. Age-class evenness also indicates the presence of continuous regeneration and healthy stand replacement (ecological functioning).

[^05_ind_tree_age-1]: Peter Lowe, Saul Herbert

## Measuring

Check-box of size classes present:

::: two-columns
-   \< 7cm (tin of beans)
-   7 - 30cm (approx. 1 m circumference)[^05_ind_tree_age-2]
-   30 - 60 (approx. 1.9m circumference)
-   \> 60 cm[^05_ind_tree_age-3]
:::

[^05_ind_tree_age-2]: Chris Reid: very large range, consider splitting

[^05_ind_tree_age-3]: Jim Smith-Wright: a higher class may be useful

> Alternative 1: Estimate abundance/cover for each size class. This would allow size-class diversity to be summarised by e.g. a [Shannon diversity index](https://bio.libretexts.org/Sandboxes/tholmberg_at_nwcc.edu/General_Ecology_Ecology/Chapter_22%3A_Biodiversity/22.5%3A_Measuring_Biodiveristy).

> Alternative 2: Measure dbh of all trees in plot (over a given size), allowing e.g. standard deviation to be calculated (as well as size-class diversity)[^05_ind_tree_age-4].

[^05_ind_tree_age-4]: Kevin Watts suggests standard deviation of tree dbh as the single most important structural indicator of biodiversity

Could be combined with measurement of [regeneration classes](13_regen.qmd), and possibly [veteran trees](11_avts.qmd).

### Comments on estimates

All value functions have a similar shape.

Complete agreement on upper and lower value.

-   Some put maximum value at 3 classes.

# Respondent comments

### Considerations for indicator design

Abundance of different sizes (and their distribution) is important: one dominant class + one slightly older tree this is not the same as a good mix of two age classes[^05_ind_tree_age-5]

[^05_ind_tree_age-5]: Saul Herbert

-   Number of classes alone might mislead, e.g. 3/5 could all be intermediate classes, with no old or young

-   Number of trees in each class would be much more useful than cover (because bigger trees have more cover)

Individual size classes may have different "Value": consider a score for each individual class present and sum (to a max of 100), with less points for intermediate stages [^05_ind_tree_age-6].

[^05_ind_tree_age-6]: Alasdair Firth

May be difficult to distinguish between more than three age classes, and yet condition could likely improve further[^05_ind_tree_age-7].

[^05_ind_tree_age-7]: Saul Herbert

### Priority exceptions

Woodland Type

-   Young woodland and woodland creation sites [^05_ind_tree_age-8], up to 20 years[^05_ind_tree_age-9]

    -   Maybe 2 size classes would be max expected.

    -   Larger trees may pre-exist.

    -   Lower importance in young wood[^05_ind_tree_age-10]

-   Wet wood: good condition at lower number of classes [^05_ind_tree_age-11]

-   Scrub woodland

    -   May be difficult to age e.g. Gorse, bramble[^05_ind_tree_age-12]

-   Upland and montane woodlands[^05_ind_tree_age-13]

    -   Wont have more than three, but that would be good[^05_ind_tree_age-14]

-   Wood pasture/ffridd[^05_ind_tree_age-15]

    -   Less penalised for 1 missing class.

    -   Older trees likely to be more permanent[^05_ind_tree_age-16]

        -   Could mean that condition will be easier to sustain on those sites, but not necessarily "improve" the condition score[^05_ind_tree_age-17]

    -   Scale/number of plots may need to be bigger to represent size classes present[^05_ind_tree_age-18]

-   Active, short rotation coppice[^05_ind_tree_age-19]

    -   Age-diversity may be between coups, rather than within plots

Scale and landscape context[^05_ind_tree_age-20]

[^05_ind_tree_age-20]: Peter Lowe, Kylie Jones Mattock, Hannah Patterson

-   A variety of even aged stands at different ages may be OK

-   May not vary within plot, but be good across a site or even sub compartment[^05_ind_tree_age-21].

-   Lower importance where landscape has plenty of woodland with diversity of ages[^05_ind_tree_age-22]

### Lower priority exceptions

Designed Landscapes[^05_ind_tree_age-23]

[^05_ind_tree_age-23]: David Venables

> Could group with woodpasture etc. Otherwise, where this scores poorly, it might just be poor condition.

Dbh not always a reliable indicator of age[^05_ind_tree_age-24]

[^05_ind_tree_age-24]: Richard Brown

Pioneer species often regenerate in even aged cohorts[^05_ind_tree_age-25]

[^05_ind_tree_age-25]: Peter Lowe

> While this may make even-age structure more likely among pioneer species, it does not necessarily mean that the impact of age-structure on condition should be treated differently in that context. If they are all one age, condition is lower.[^05_ind_tree_age-26]

[^05_ind_tree_age-26]: Ewan McHenry

Non-management zones[^05_ind_tree_age-27]

[^05_ind_tree_age-27]: Dean Kirkland

> These may just score how they score.

Diseased woodland[^05_ind_tree_age-28] - some cohorts may be dying.

### Concerns already covered by this or other indicators

Important lichen stands[^05_ind_tree_age-30]

[^05_ind_tree_age-30]: Kylie Jones Mattock

> If the limitation here is light it may be better captured by other indicators. Not sure why an "age distribution effect on condition" would be have particularly important exceptions RE lichens[^05_ind_tree_age-31]

# Other approaches

## Woodland Wildlife Toolkit & NFI

Value score depends on number of classes present, out of three

If tree species is not a birch, cherry or Sorbus

-   0 – 20 years (Young)

-   21 - 150 years (Intermediate)

-   \>150 years (Old)

For birch, cherry or Sorbus species: 0 - 20 years (Young) , 21 - 60 years (Intermediate) and \>60 years (Old)

## Current WT estate condition assessment

Records DAFOR for 5 age categories: \<20 yo;  20-50; 50-100, 100-200, veteran

> Note: what exactly DAFOR means for veterans is unclear

> Note: DOMIN scale would be preferred over DAFOR.
