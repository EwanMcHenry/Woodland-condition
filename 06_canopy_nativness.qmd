# Canopy nativeness

## Justification

Native trees have higher wildlife value, as native biodiversity has co-evolved with these species over millennium.

## Measuring

Estimate total cover of: tree canopy (percentage of plot area within the drip line), shrub canopy and open habitat.

Estimate the percentage of those canopy volumes that are **site**-native.

> Note: There is confusion between "percentage OF canopy THAT IS native" and "percentage native canopy cover". This is explicitly the percentage **of the canopy**.

### Comments on data

Value functions:

-   Similar general trends, but a lot of variation - Different shapes - Some linear, some S-shaped, some exponential, some logarithmic("r" shaped) - disagreement RE max value

> Recommend focusing reassessments on
>
> -   The areas of 0-25% native and 75-100%
>
> -   when a value of 100 is reached

Weightings:

-   Fairly wide spread - 5 or so think it among most important - rest think it is middle-importance

### Considerations for indicator design

Non-natives can provide important structural functions not provided by the native species present, important to note where removing them may be adverse[^06_canopy_nativness-1].

[^06_canopy_nativness-1]: Kylie Jones Mattock, Dave Bonsall

> Assessment should give space to note significant structural contributions of non-natives, focusing on where native species are not providing those structures.
>
> Good to record for management. For the condition score the structural complexity added by non-natives would be captured by those specific indicators.

DOMIN cover-abundance scale might be used instead of un-prompted percentages. May be more reliable than DAFOR[^06_canopy_nativness-2].

:::

Consider measuring at different height bands, using same layers as for, Vertical Structure and Horizontal Complexity. At least, there should be a prompt to note where non-native component is mainly in upper/lower canopy.

Consider specifying a height requirements for trees/shrubs to count (3m for trees?).

Would open habitat include areas with e.g. 2.5m regenerating trees?

A measure of bramble and bracken specifically might be useful

-   Relates directly to light and could inform woodland management (e.g. thinning)

-   Not necessarily as part of condition score, but easy to assess and useful info for manager - Nearest 20% is good enough

### Priority exceptions

Some non-natives not as bad as others

-   Larch and Scots pine [^06_canopy_nativness-3], honorary natives such as sweet chestnut in the SE, sycamore[^06_canopy_nativness-4], Douglas fir[^06_canopy_nativness-5], beech?[^06_canopy_nativness-6].

-   Specific tree species that are part of targeted conservation management of wildlife species (e.g. potentially goshawk and red squirrel)[^06_canopy_nativness-7].

-   Non-native species that have ranges that overlap with UK-native species (European larch, Norway spruce etc)[^06_canopy_nativness-8]

-   Species that share mycorrhizal associations with native trees[^06_canopy_nativness-9]

-   UK-native species that aren't site-native, but are ecologically site-appropriate.

[^06_canopy_nativness-3]: Peter Lowe, Alasdair Firth

[^06_canopy_nativness-4]: Daniel Aitken, Dave Bonsall, Jim Smith-Wright: Sycamore can provide similar bark pH to ash which could be important for lichens associated with ash, particularly in context of ash dieback.

Shelter belts, often need to be non-native to be effective[^06_canopy_nativness-15]

[^06_canopy_nativness-15]: Ian Moss

> Here there may be a trade-off that should be made explicitly: an accepted loss of potential wildlife value (i.e. ecological condition) for the service of shelter, a non-native shelter-belt would just have a low condition score.

Wildlife reserves, ground conditions, pests/diseases[^06_canopy_nativness-16]

> Dont understand these one...

### Concerns already covered by this or other indicators

What to do with overlapping canopy of native/non-native species?

> Considering % canopy volume should deal with this.

Non-native veteran trees can provide significant wildlife value e.g. in historic parkland[^06_canopy_nativness-17]

[^06_canopy_nativness-17]: Chris Reid

-   e.g. sweet chestnut heart rot provides similar habitat niche to oak heart rot.

> This should be accounted for within the Veteran Trees indicator.

Some natives can be detrimental if in monoculture, e.g. yew, holly[^06_canopy_nativness-18], or otherwise low species diversity[^06_canopy_nativness-19]

[^06_canopy_nativness-18]: Jim Smith-Wright

[^06_canopy_nativness-19]: David Venables

> This is definitely worth making a note of, but may be best dealt with using the Native Tree and Shrub Species Richness indicator.

Commercial plantations and wood lots[^06_canopy_nativness-20]

[^06_canopy_nativness-20]: Kylie Jones Mattock, David Venables, Rhiannon Hoy

> The "negative" impacts of management of native plantations should be picked up in other indicators. Non-native plantations would be expected to score poorly for this indicator.

Native PAWS[^06_canopy_nativness-21]

[^06_canopy_nativness-21]: Dean Kirkland

> If restoration status is critical etc, this should be picked up by other indicators.

# Other approaches

## Woodland Wildlife Toolkit & NFI

Occupancy of natives at whole woodland level

-   3: \> 80% (90 % in Scotland)

-   2: 50-80%

-   1: \< 50%

## Current WT estate condition assessment

Canopy dominated by 1/2 species (T/F)

> Note no specific mention of "native".
