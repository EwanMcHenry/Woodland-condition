# Canopy nativeness

## Justification

Native trees have higher wildlife value, as native biodiversity has co-evolved with these species over millennium.

## Measuring

Estimate total cover of: tree canopy (percentage of plot area within the drip line), shrub canopy and open habitat.

Estimate the percentage of those canopy volumes that are **site**-native.

> Note: There is confusion between "percentage OF canopy THAT IS native" and "percentage native canopy cover". This is explicitly the percentage **of the canopy**.

Bramble and bracken cover also recorded for management info[^06_canopy_nativness-1].

[^06_canopy_nativness-1]: Relates directly to light and could inform woodland management (e.g. thinning). Nearest 20% is good enough.

#### Continuous Value function

```{r vf Tree age size distribution - continuous, echo = F , results="asis"}

#### Weights

```{r vf Tree age size distribution - weights, fig.width= 4, echo = F , results="asis"}

ggplot_resp_weight_ind(indicator_name = indicator_name)

```

#### Standardised weights

```{r std weights, fig.width= 4, echo = F , results="asis"}

ggplot_resp_weight_ind(indicator_name = indicator_name, weight_variable = "weight_standardised")

```

Weights, standardised so that all respondents varied the same amount

### Comments on data

Value functions:

-   Similar general trends, but a lot of variation - Different shapes - Some linear, some S-shaped, some exponential, some logarithmic("r" shaped) - disagreement RE max value
-   Disagreement most important at each end of the scale - **focus review there**

# Respondent comments

### Considerations for indicator design

Non-natives can provide important structural functions not provided by the native species present, important to note where removing them may be adverse[^06_canopy_nativness-2].

[^06_canopy_nativness-2]: Kylie Jones Mattock, Dave Bonsall

> Space needed to note significant structural contributions of non-natives, focusing on where native species are not providing those structures. Useful for management info, for condition scoring those non-native contributions would be captured by those specific indicators.
>
> Consider measuring at different height bands. At least, there should be a prompt to note where non-native component is mainly in upper/lower canopy.

DOMIN cover-abundance scale might be used instead of un-prompted percentages. May be more reliable than DAFOR[^06_canopy_nativness-3].

Open habitat needs strict definition - i.e. tree height etc.

### Priority exceptions

Some non-natives not as bad as others

-   Douglas fir[^06_canopy_nativness-4], Larch and Scots pine [^06_canopy_nativness-5], honorary natives such as sweet chestnut in the SE, sycamore[^06_canopy_nativness-6], beech?[^06_canopy_nativness-7].

-   Specific species part of targeted species conservation (e.g. potentially goshawk and red squirrel)[^06_canopy_nativness-8].

-   Non-native species that have ranges that overlap with UK-native species (European larch, Norway spruce etc)[^06_canopy_nativness-9], or that share mycorrhizal associations with native trees[^06_canopy_nativness-10]

-   UK-native species that aren't site-native, but are ecologically site-appropriate.

[^06_canopy_nativness-6]: Daniel Aitken, Dave Bonsall, Jim Smith-Wright: Sycamore can provide similar bark pH to ash which could be important for lichens associated with ash, particularly in context of ash dieback.

### Lower priority exceptions

Arboretums/designed landscapes[^06_canopy_nativness-14], amenity woodlands[^06_canopy_nativness-15], urban, shelter belts[^06_canopy_nativness-16] often need to be non-native to be effective.

[^06_canopy_nativness-15]: Kylie Jones Mattock

[^06_canopy_nativness-16]: Ian Moss

> May score well for other indicators, but advising no ecological reason for an exception RE native component's impact on condition. Often there may be a trade-off with services etc. That tradeoff should be made explicit: an accepted loss of potential wildlife value (i.e. ecological condition) for the service of shelter etc, a non-native shelter-belt would just have a low condition score.

Wildlife reserves, ground conditions, pests/diseases[^06_canopy_nativness-17]

[^06_canopy_nativness-17]: David Venables

> Don't understand these one...

### Concerns already covered by this or other indicators

Where non-natives provide important structures missing in native component. e.g. veteran trees in historic parkland[^06_canopy_nativness-18]

[^06_canopy_nativness-18]: Chris Reid

-   e.g. sweet chestnut heart rot provides similar habitat niche to oak heart rot.

> This should be accounted for within the Veteran Trees indicator.

Some natives can be detrimental if in monoculture, e.g. yew, holly[^06_canopy_nativness-19], or otherwise low species diversity[^06_canopy_nativness-20]

[^06_canopy_nativness-19]: Jim Smith-Wright

[^06_canopy_nativness-20]: David Venables

> This is definitely worth making a note of, but may be best dealt with using the Native Tree and Shrub Species Richness indicator.

Commercial plantations and wood lots[^06_canopy_nativness-21]

[^06_canopy_nativness-21]: Kylie Jones Mattock, David Venables, Rhiannon Hoy

> The "negative" impacts of management of native plantations should be picked up in other indicators. Non-native plantations would be expected to score poorly for this indicator.

Native PAWS[^06_canopy_nativness-22]

[^06_canopy_nativness-22]: Dean Kirkland

> If restoration status is critical etc, this should be picked up by other indicators.

# Other approaches

## Woodland Wildlife Toolkit & NFI

Occupancy of natives at whole woodland level

-   3: \> 80% (90 % in Scotland)

-   2: 50-80%

-   1: \< 50%

## Current WT estate condition assessment

Canopy dominated by 1/2 species (T/F)

> Note no specific mention of "native".
