# Vertical structure

## Justification

Greater vertical complexity provides a greater range of resources/niches[^07_vert_struct-1]

[^07_vert_struct-1]: Chris Reid, Peter Lowe, Saul Herbert

## Measuring

Tick box for presence of canopy cover at each height class.

> Alternative: percentage cover or DOMIN score at each height band. This would capture more management-relevant nuance and allow a diversity metrics to be calculated.

Suggested height bands:

::: two-columns
-   Upper canopy: \>15 m

-   10- 15 m

-   5-10 m

-   Shrub layer (2-5m): 3m suggested by Peter Lowe

-   Field layer 0.4- 2 m (containing tall shrubs and low shrubs)

-   Ground layer

-   Open habitat (Canopy absent above 2 m)
:::

Note - Should use the same height classes as Horizontal Complexity

### Comments on data

VFs:

-   Good general agreement - may re-consider 2 and 3 layers value

-   Note that the form included a "0" canopy layers option, which is meaningless

Weights:

-   Most think middling importance - a few think among most important, a few least important

# Respondent comments

### Considerations for indicator design

What is a "Layer"? Need to overcome confusion around distinctiveness of layering, i.e. One continuous complex layer present through all height strata is not one layer [^07_vert_struct-2]

### Priority exceptions

Woodland type:

-   Creation sites/ young woods[^07_vert_struct-4]:

    -   Unlikely to have more than one or two layers[^07_vert_struct-5]

    -   Can still aim to maximise in woodland creation, e.g. by mixing scrub, trees, variable sward. Could remove upper categories for younger woods[^07_vert_struct-6]

-   Rainforest: Dense continuous canopy could be bad for lichens and bryophytes[^07_vert_struct-7]

[^07_vert_struct-6]: Saul Herbert

[^07_vert_struct-7]: Peter Lowe, Adam Thorogood

> This will require careful thought, and may mean that condition drops off with increasing complexity (after a point) in those sites

-   Montane & upland: limited by wind/ severe conditions[^07_vert_struct-8], may only develop two layers[^07_vert_struct-9]. Coastal exposed sites similar[^07_vert_struct-10].

> Does that mean that two is "good", or that it is just hard to get to "good" in this context?

-   Wood pasture/ffridd: often has simple structure[^07_vert_struct-11]

[^07_vert_struct-11]: Peter Lowe, Kylie Jones Mattock, David Logan, Dean Kirkland, Karen Hornigold, Sonia Lorenzo-Martin

> Does this mean that there is a different relationship between condition and vertical structure? Or are those sites with simple structure just not in as good condition?
>
> Could consider lower weighting for this context.

-   Atlantic oak: can have poor structure, but still have regeneration (two classes with no intermediate classes)[^07_vert_struct-12]

[^07_vert_struct-12]: Richard Brown

> This may simply imply poor structure?

-   Coppices: vertical structure is at between-coupe scale[^07_vert_struct-13]

-   Scrub thicket habitat[^07_vert_struct-14]

-   Wetwood[^07_vert_struct-15]

[^07_vert_struct-13]: Peter Lowe

[^07_vert_struct-14]: Jim Smith-Wright

[^07_vert_struct-15]: Sonia Lorenzo-Martin

Where only upper and lower are present, e.g. with recruitment lost to herbivory[^07_vert_struct-16]

[^07_vert_struct-16]: Sonia Lorenzo-Martin

Scale - more important in smaller woods[^07_vert_struct-17]

[^07_vert_struct-17]: Liam Plummer

> This may be related to the scale that vertical structure is measured at[^07_vert_struct-18]

[^07_vert_struct-18]: Ewan McHenry

Where a layer may only be represented by non-native[^07_vert_struct-19]

[^07_vert_struct-19]: Alasdair Firth

> Ideally noted in native-occupancy indicator, but still unsure as to how to properly deal with it in terms of contribution to condition.

Landscape scale: e.g. high dense groves with little structure may be rare in the landscape.

### Lower priority exceptions

Wildlife species: some species may depend on simple structure (e.g. pied flycatcher)[^07_vert_struct-20]

[^07_vert_struct-20]: Peter Lowe

Topography[^07_vert_struct-21]

[^07_vert_struct-21]: David Venables

> More variation expected in more rugged sites?

### Concerns already covered by this or other indicators

Frequency and diversity is important, a single tree with canopy at all heights is not the same as varying complexity of structure[^07_vert_struct-22]

[^07_vert_struct-22]: Saul Herbert

> Using DOMIN cover at each layer should overcome this

# Other approaches

## Woodland Wildlife Toolkit & NFI

Number of canopy stories present from (note no specific height bands):

::: two-colums
-   Upper

-   Middle

-   Lower

-   Shrub
:::

Favorable: 4 or more stories, or "complex"

Intermediate: 2-3 stories

Unfavorable: 1 story
