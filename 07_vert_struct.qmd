# Vertical structure

## Justification

Greater vertical complexity provides a greater range of resources/niches[^07_vert_struct-1]

[^07_vert_struct-1]: \[\[Chris Reid\]\], \[\[Peter Lowe\]\], \[\[Saul Herbert\]\]

## Measuring

Tick box for presence of canopy cover at each height class.

> Better option: percentage cover or DOMIN score at each height band. This would capture more management-relevent nuance and allow a diversity metrics to be calculated.

![](images/Vertical%20Structure%202023-11-13%2016.26.19.excalidraw.png)

Suggested height bands:

-   Upper canopy, \>15 m

-   10- 15 m

-   5-10 m

-   Shrub layer (2-5m) - 3m suggested by \[\[Peter Lowe\]\]

-   Field layer 0.4- 2 m (containing tall shrubs and low shrubs)

-   Ground layer

-   Open habitat (Canopy absent above 2 m)

Note - Should use the same height classes as Horizontal Complexity

### Comments on data

VFs:

-   Good general agreement - may re-consider 2 and 3 layers value

-   Note that the form included a "0" canopy layers option, which is meaningless

Weights:

-   Most think middling importance - a few think amongst most important, a few least important

# Respondent comments

### Considerations for indicator design

What is a "Layer"? Need to overcome confusion around distinctiveness of layering, i.e. One continuous complex layer present through all height strata is not one layer [^07_vert_struct-2]

### Priority exceptions

Woodland type:

-   Creation sites/ young woods:

    -   Unlikely to have more than one or two layers[^07_vert_struct-4]

    -   Can still aim to maximise in woodland creation, e.g. by mixing scrub, trees, variable sward. Could remove upper categories for younger woods[^07_vert_struct-5]

-   Rainforest: Dense continuous canopy could be bad for lichens and bryophytes[^07_vert_struct-6]

[^07_vert_struct-4]: \[\[Chris Reid\]\], \[\[Ian Moss\]\], \[\[Kylie Jones Mattock\]\]

[^07_vert_struct-5]: \[\[Saul Herbert\]\]

[^07_vert_struct-6]: \[\[Peter Lowe\]\], \[\[Adam Thorogood\]\]

> This will require careful thought, and may mean that condition drops off with increasing complexity (after a point) in those sites

-   Montane & upland: limited by wind/ severe conditions[^07_vert_struct-7], may only develop two layers[^07_vert_struct-8]

[^07_vert_struct-7]: \[\[Chris Reid\]\], \[\[Kylie Jones Mattock\]\]

[^07_vert_struct-8]: \[\[Ian Moss\]\]

> Does that mean that two is "good", or that it is just hard to get to "good" in this context?

-   Wood pasture/ffridd: often has simple structure[^07_vert_struct-9]

[^07_vert_struct-9]: \[\[Peter Lowe\]\], \[\[Kylie Jones Mattock\]\]

> Does this mean that there is a different relationship between condition and vertical structure? Or are those sites with simple structure just not in as good condition?
>
> Could consider lower weighting for this context.

-   Atlantic oak: can have poor structure, but still have regeneration (two classes with no intermediate classes)[^07_vert_struct-10]

[^07_vert_struct-10]: \[\[Richard Brown\]\]

> To me this woudl simply imply poorer structure

-   Coppices: vertical structure is at between-coupe scale[^07_vert_struct-11]

-   Scrub thicket habitat[^07_vert_struct-12]

[^07_vert_struct-11]: \[\[Peter Lowe\]\]

[^07_vert_struct-12]: \[\[Jim Smith-Wright\]\]

Scale - more important in smaller woods[^07_vert_struct-13]

[^07_vert_struct-13]: \[\[Liam Plummer\]\]

> This may be related to the scale that vertical structure is measured at[^07_vert_struct-14]

[^07_vert_struct-14]: \[\[Ewan McHenry\]\]

Where a layer may only be represented by non-native[^07_vert_struct-15]

[^07_vert_struct-15]: \[\[Alasdair Firth\]\]

> Ideally noted in native-occupancy indicator, but still unsure as to how to properly deal with it in terms of contribution to condition.

Landscape scale: e.g. high dense groves with little structure may be rare in the landscape.

### Lower priority exceptions

Wildlife species: some species may depend on simple structure (e.g. pied flycatcher)[^07_vert_struct-16]

[^07_vert_struct-16]: \[\[Peter Lowe\]\]

### Concerns already covered by this or other indicators

Frequency and diversity is important, a single tree with canopy at all heights is not the same as varying complexity of structure[^07_vert_struct-17]

[^07_vert_struct-17]: \[\[Saul Herbert\]\]

> Using DOMIN cover at eahc layer should overcome this

# Other approaches

## Woodland Wildlife Toolkit & NFI

Number of canopy storeys present from (note no specific height bands):

-   Upper

-   Middle

-   Lower

-   Shrub

Favourable: 4 or more stories, or "complex"

Intermediate: 2-3 stories

Unfavorable: 1 story
