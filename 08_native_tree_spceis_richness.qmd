## **Note to round 2 respondents**

**Since round 1, this indicator has been changed from "number of species" to "proportion of appropriate species". Your form still has the original data in it. You might want to start by changing the "numbers of species" that you entered into percentages, then reviewing based on what other respondents have provided.**

## Justification

More tree species typically reflect greater niche space and resilience to pests/disease and climate change.

## Measuring

Record a list the native tree species within each plot, along with DOMIN cover class. Additional species detected during woodland walk should also be recorded.

:::

Species lists will be [**automatically**]{.underline} compared to a list of site-appropriate species, and the proportion of appropriate species present will be calculated. Site-appropriate species will be pre-defined, initially based on The Woodland Trust's Tree Species Handbook [@hotchkissalastair] (See @tbl-approp_spp). Some species will be locally appropriate, and these will also be automatically assigned, but editable.

> **Alternative:** Instead of a simple proportion (i.e. "70% of site-appropriate species occupied the site"), apply different weightings to species to reflect their desirability, potentially based on:
>
> -   Rarity and contribution to landscape-scale biodiversity (e.g. [Beta diversity](https://methodsblog.com/2015/05/27/beta_diversity/)).
>
> -   Functional redundancy (weighting species higher that fulfill ecological functions not well-represented in the community)
>
> -   Dispersal ability (weighting pioneer species and long-distance dispersers less).
>
> -   Other descriptions "site appropriateness", however that is defined.

## Appropriate species list {#sec-appropriate-species-list}

The Tree Species Handbook[@hotchkissalastair], includes lists of tree species deemed appropriate for 18 separate woodland communities, divided according to:

-   Upland/lowland

-   Acidic/base-rich/wet

-   Structure: groves (\> 70% canopy cover)/open wooded habitats (20-70% canopy cover)/glade(\<20% canopy cover).

These lists were intended to support the establishment of locally appropriate and distinctive woods and trees without constraining this to specific National Vegetation Classification (NVC) communities.

> **Alternative species lists sources:**
>
> -   NVC type[@whitbreada.m.1992]
>
> -   Native species predicted at the site by Forest Research's [Ecological Site Classification model (ESC)](https://www.forestresearch.gov.uk/tools-and-resources/fthr/ecological-site-classification/)
>
> -   Expert-expectations based on historic management, disease and site objectives (e.g. if there is an objective to manage for a specific habitat type) etc.

### Comments on data

Different ideas as to the shape of that relationship: linear[^08_native_tree_spceis_richness-1], vs sigmoid, S-shaped relationship[^08_native_tree_spceis_richness-2].

# Challenge: dealing with species detectability

Even if species are present at a site, their detection cannot be guaranteed. There is always a risk that one or more species is missed, regardless of using survey plots or woodland walks. This risk will vary depending on many factors (e.g. time spent searching, area searched, surveyor skill etc.), which - if unaccounted for - will bias results in a way that has no ecological relevance. Raw (also called "naive") species richness estimates are well-understood to be frequently biased in this way [@mackenzie2005]. Even ecological factors can influence detectability in a way that might lead to spurious naive species richness estimates. For example, more habitat area is well understood to increase species richness[@matthews2016], but smaller sites are often surveyed with greater intensity (similar effort over a smaller area). This may mean a greater proportion of species present are detected at smaller sites, erroneously inflating their condition score, compared to larger sites.

Fortunately, the toolbox of modern ecologists contains sampling and analytically methods to account for this bias. Well-established methods include [Occupancy Modelling techniques](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6362448/#:~:text=Multispecies%20occupancy%20models%20can%20estimate,while%20accounting%20for%20imperfect%20detection.) , or [Species Accumulation Curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species_discovery_curve). Replication of surveys is a necessary requirement for these methods, and - at least partially - randomised, representative survey locations are highly advised.

> It may be appropriate to add a number of additional "sub-"plots where only tree species are recorded (I advise two within 20-30m of main plots in a random directions).

An analysis pipeline could be set up to automatically estimate "true" species richness of a site/sub-compartment/zone, along with associated uncertainty around that estimate.

### Priority exceptions

Woodland type

-   Montane [^08_native_tree_spceis_richness-3] and upland woods: less expected[^08_native_tree_spceis_richness-4]

-   Wetwood[^08_native_tree_spceis_richness-5]

-   Planted woodland creation - may have a more even mix of species than expected elsewhere[^08_native_tree_spceis_richness-6], but natural colonisation may be dominated by pioneering species[^08_native_tree_spceis_richness-7]

-   Wood pasture[^08_native_tree_spceis_richness-8]

-   Coppice[^08_native_tree_spceis_richness-9]

Topography: flat, homogeneous ground will have lower expected tree species diversity[^08_native_tree_spceis_richness-10]

[^08_native_tree_spceis_richness-10]: Alasdair Firth

Species may have different functional traits and wildlife value e.g. oak[^08_native_tree_spceis_richness-11]. Presence/number of different functional groups of trees (e.g. nectar sources) may be more important than species number[^08_native_tree_spceis_richness-12]

[^08_native_tree_spceis_richness-12]: Jim Smith-Wright

Scale/landscape context: a small wood plot with a few species that are otherwise rare in the landscape, or provide other landscape-scale functioning[^08_native_tree_spceis_richness-13]

[^08_native_tree_spceis_richness-13]: Alasdair Firth

Avoid driving inappropriate species diversification e.g. :

-   Inappropriate supplementary planting within Ancient woodland sites to boost species richness[^08_native_tree_spceis_richness-14].

-   Where simplified species structure is part of management for target species/community[^08_native_tree_spceis_richness-15]

-   Where specific but relatively simplified habitat enhances biodiversity at larger scales[^08_native_tree_spceis_richness-16].

-   Where inappropriate for landscape/designation[^08_native_tree_spceis_richness-17]

# Other approaches

## Woodland Wildlife Toolkit

Record main tree and shrub species present in the upper canopy (\>5m) within plots

-   3: \>= 5 species

-   2: 3-4 species

-   1: 0-2 species

## NFI

1 ha plot count tree and shrub species combined

-   Favorable: \> 4 species

-   Intermediate: 3 - 4

-   Unfavorable: 0 - 2

## Current WT estate condition assessment

Number of trees and shrubs present (recorded separately)
