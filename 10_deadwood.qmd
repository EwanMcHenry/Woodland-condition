# Deadwood

## Justification

Deadwood provides habitat for a range of native species. Takes a lot and a wide range of types and stages of decay to maximise value[^10_deadwood-1]

[^10_deadwood-1]: Saul Herbert

## Measuring

Divide plot into quarters and count number of quarters with each deadwood type.

Deadwood types:

-   Deadwood in canopy \>0.5 m long, \>20 cm diameter at narrowest

-   Deadwood on ground \>0.5 m long, \>20 cm diameter at narrowest

-   Stumps 0.5 - 1m tall, \>20 cm diameter at narrowest

-   Standing deadwood \> 1 m tall, \>20 cm diameter at narrowest

Total sum for score (later development could weight deadwood types differently)

### Considerations for indicator design

Potential clustering of deadwood because of windfall etc could affect plot scoring[^10_deadwood-2].

[^10_deadwood-2]: Jim Smith-Wright

Deadwood volume estimation is already an UKWAS requirement.

If a lower requirement was given for you woodland, how long would that last for?

### Priority exceptions

Woodland type

-   Young woodland

    -   Will have less dead wood [^10_deadwood-3], but there may still be some worth recording in surrounding hedges etc[^10_deadwood-4].

    -   Less important here[^10_deadwood-5]

    -   <div>

        > Need to decide between having a specific value function, or reduce weighting

        </div>

-   Woodpasture/ parkland

    -   Potentially more deadwood expected for favorable quality[^10_deadwood-6].

    -   Could also be more important feature (higher weighting).

    -   May need larger/more plots[^10_deadwood-7].

[^10_deadwood-6]: Chris Reid, Dean Kirkland

[^10_deadwood-7]: Liam Plummer, Karen Hornigold

Cause is important context, e.g. If from disease [^10_deadwood-8] or large-scale windblown event[^10_deadwood-9]

[^10_deadwood-8]: Peter Lowe

[^10_deadwood-9]: Kylie Jones Mattock

Type of deadwood is important for its value

-   Hard/softwood[^10_deadwood-10], shaded/open[^10_deadwood-11], species/nativeness of tree[^10_deadwood-12], hollowing, submerged/wet - On living/deadwood interface- important for saproxylics[^10_deadwood-13]

[^10_deadwood-12]: Kylie Jones Mattock

### Lower priority exceptions

AWR sites where all wood is harvested[^10_deadwood-14] and coppice[^10_deadwood-15]

[^10_deadwood-14]: Dave Bonsall

[^10_deadwood-15]: Peter Lowe, Dave Bonsall, Kylie Jones Mattock, Bob Epsom

> May just accept lower condition score here, or alter management to retain deadwood.

Note the high diameter threshold for deadwood to be counted[^10_deadwood-16]

[^10_deadwood-16]: Jim Smith-Wright

Some nutrient sensitive areas may be undesirable[^10_deadwood-17]

[^10_deadwood-17]: Jim Smith-Wright

Higher importance to maintain where there has been historic continuity, compared to establishment of deadwood[^10_deadwood-18].

[^10_deadwood-18]: Alasdair Firth

May take a long time to accumulate, potentially making progress seem impossible[^10_deadwood-19].

[^10_deadwood-19]: Louise Hackett

### Concerns already covered by this or other indicators

Excessive deadwood volume may indicate poor condition[^10_deadwood-20], in PAWs it may restrict ground flora and regeneration[^10_deadwood-21]

[^10_deadwood-20]: Alasdair Firth

[^10_deadwood-21]: Hannah Patterson

> This should be covered by other indicators (e.g. regeneration). Possibly noting the presumed cause there (i.e. suppressed by excessive deadwood).

May represent high fuel load in extreme cases[^10_deadwood-22] and a fire risk in sites with a lot of public access.

[^10_deadwood-22]: Peter Lowe, Kylie Jones Mattock, David Venables

> This should be an explicit trade-off between fire risk and the ecological value of deadwood. The indicator should not discourage/be apathetic towards fire risk management options that also promote good quality deadwood. A stat such as "95% of urban woods don't have enough deadwood due to fire-burning" could be part of e.g. a public awareness campaign.

Where this restricts access/safety[^10_deadwood-23]

[^10_deadwood-23]: David Venables

> An explicit trade-off is made here

# Other approaches

## Woodland Wildlife Toolkit

Record on woodland walk and in plots

-   Standing \> 1 m tall

-   Ground \>50 cm long, \>20 cm diameter at narrowest, including stumps 0.5 - 1 m tall

-   Deadwood on live trees

## NFI

Estimated deadwood volume

-   Favorable: \>80 m<sup>3</sup> ha<sup>-1</sup>

-   Intermediate: 20 - 80 m<sup>3</sup> ha<sup>-1</sup>

-   Unfavorable: \< 20 m<sup>3</sup> ha<sup>-1</sup>

## Current WT estate condition assessment

DAFOR for standing and fallen deadwood separately

## Notes

Richard Brown and Dave Bonsall consider the method unrealistic, as it will not pick up much deadwood. Richard Brown mentioned quarter-plot division is unnecessarily complex. Ewan McHenry and Peter Lowe have trailed in Assynt and thought it worked very well and is relatively quick, simple and informative.
