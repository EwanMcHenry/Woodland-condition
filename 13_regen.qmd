# Regeneration of native trees and shrubs

## Justification

Successful regeneration of trees and shrubs (over relatively long time) is an indicator of the vital functioning of woodlands.

-   Enough seedling survival and recruitment into larger trees/shrubs is needed, with enough frequency, to ensure woodland resilience, dynamism etc[^13_regen-1].

-   Indicator of herbivory, light, dynamism, natural processes etc [^13_regen-2]

[^13_regen-2]: Saul Herbert

Too much may be bad, particularly if single-species[^13_regen-3]: may indicate lack of disturbance e.g by large herbivores[^13_regen-4]

[^13_regen-4]: Saul Herbert

## Measuring

Record presence for each regeneration class, separately for native and non-native species.

-   Seedlings (\<50 cm tall)

-   Saplings (â‰¥50 cm tall and \<4 cm in diameter)

-   Young trees of 4-7 cm diameter

> measurement easily combined with tree age distribution
>
> Alternative 1: DOMIN scale for each class, would be more informative, particularly pointing to where there may be too much regeneration (e.g. around veteran trees)

### Comments on data

Disagreement in shape of relationship - A lot of variation around value of 1 and 2 classes

# Respondent comments

### Considerations for indicator design

Regeneration classes of shrubs require refinement

Need to provide some estimate of abundance, to show when there is too much and estiamte survival between regen classes.

Recruitment from larger seedlings to saplings is most important, only happens when light above species-specific threshold[^13_regen-5]

[^13_regen-5]: Peter Lowe

Would planted trees count as regenerating age class?[^13_regen-6]

[^13_regen-6]: Saul Herbert

### Priority exceptions

Seasonality will have a big impact, early spring many class 1, then lost to browsing[^13_regen-7]

[^13_regen-7]: Jim Smith-Wright

Woodland type

-   Wood pasture: Less regeneration expected/desired, depending on grazing pulses etc[^13_regen-8]. Protection may be required to ensure regen[^13_regen-9]

-   Rainforest and other areas with important lower plant assemblages[^13_regen-10]

    > more emphasises needed to identify when there is "too much"

-   Woodland creation sites[^13_regen-11]: There may be no seed sources[^13_regen-12], lower importance when planting, greater importance when relying on natural colonisation[^13_regen-13], more variable growth rates [^13_regen-14]

Spatial scale: Regen is important at site, but not necessarily at plot-scale[^13_regen-15]. Its OK to have no regen in an individual plot, as long as it is elsewhere. Good to have temporal continuity, but also spatial patchiness[^13_regen-16]

[^13_regen-15]: Dave Bonsall

[^13_regen-16]: Saul Herbert

Species that is regenerating[^13_regen-17]

[^13_regen-17]: Daniel Aitken

Closed canopy, less regen expected[^13_regen-18]

[^13_regen-18]: Dave Bonsall

> Or is lack of regen just a sign of reduced quality here?

### Lower priority exceptions

Temporal patchiness:

-   Can be sporadic, and often is[^13_regen-19], may be desirable in "Pulses"[^13_regen-20].

-   Can be ephemeral because of grazing (slugs, deer etc)[^13_regen-21]:

    -   Absence within plot-visit doesn't mean no successful recruitment over e.g. next 5 years.

-   Needs a long-term view. Regen not needed constantly to ensure good condition[^13_regen-22]

[^13_regen-19]: Alasdair Firth

[^13_regen-20]: Jim Smith-Wright, Louise Hackett

[^13_regen-21]: Peter Lowe

[^13_regen-22]: Liam Plummer

More important when existing trees are dying/diseased[^13_regen-23]

[^13_regen-23]: Peter Lowe, David Venables

> Could be indicated by Tree health and Tree Size Distribution indicators

Coppice[^13_regen-24]

[^13_regen-24]: Dave Bonsall

Availability of seed source[^13_regen-25]

[^13_regen-25]: Kylie Jones Mattock

> If no see source this could prompt supplementary planting etc.

### Concerns already covered by this or other indicators

# Other approaches

## Woodland Wildlife Toolkit

Value 1: no regen present

Value 2: 1 - 2 regen classes present

Value 3: three regen classes present

## NFI

At 1 ha square level, and component

-   Component: Saplings and seedlings Detection/non-detection

-   10 m transect per woodland section: 1m wide for seedlings, 2m wide for saplings, grouped by species -

-   Circular plots: Young trees in circular plots

Favorable: 3 regen classes present

Intermediate: 1 - 2 regen classes present (also includes 0 regen at component-level)

Unfavorable: only when no regen in 1 ha

## Current WT estate condition assessment

DAFOR for each regeneration class for native and non-native trees and shrubs separately.
