# Regeneration of native trees and shrubs

## Justification

Successful regeneration of trees and shrubs (over relatively long time) is an indicator of the vital functioning of woodlands.

-   Enough seedling survival and recruitment into larger trees/shrubs is needed, with enough frequency, to ensure woodland resilience, dynamism etc[^13_regen-1].

-   Indicator of herbivory, light, dynamism, natural processes etc [^13_regen-2]

[^13_regen-1]: \[\[Peter Lowe\]\],\[\[Alasdair Firth\]\], \[\[Chris Reid\]\]

[^13_regen-2]: \[\[Saul Herbert\]\]

Too much may be bad, particularly if single-species[^13_regen-3]: may indicate lack of disturbance e.g by large herbivores[^13_regen-4]

[^13_regen-3]: \[\[Peter Lowe\]\]

[^13_regen-4]: \[\[Saul Herbert\]\]

## Measuring

Record presence for each regeneration class, separately for native and non-native species.

-   Seedlings (\<50 cm tall)

-   Saplings (â‰¥50 cm tall and \<4 cm in diameter)

-   Young trees of 4-7 cm diameter

> measurement easily combined with tree age distribution
>
> Alternative 1: DOMIN scale for each class, would be more informative, particularly pointing to where there may be too much regeneration (e.g. around veteran trees)

### Comments on data

VFs:

-   Disagreement in shape of relationship - A lot of variation around value of 1 and 2 classes

Weights:

-   a lot of variation

# Respondent comments

### Considerations for indicator design

Seasonality will have a big impact, early spring many class 1, then lost to browsing[^13_regen-5]

[^13_regen-5]: \[\[Jim Smith-Wright\]\]

Regeneration classes of shrubs require refinement

Need to provide some estimate of abundance, at least enough to show when there is too much recruitment but ideally to show amount of survival between regen classes.

Good to have temporal continuity, but also spatial patchiness[^13_regen-6]

[^13_regen-6]: \[\[Saul Herbert\]\]

Recruitment from larger seedlings to saplings is most important, only happens when light above species-specific threshold[^13_regen-7]

[^13_regen-7]: \[\[Peter Lowe\]\]

Would planted trees count as regenerating age class?[^13_regen-8]

[^13_regen-8]: \[\[Saul Herbert\]\]

### Priority exceptions

Woodland type

-   Wood pasture: Less regeneration expected/desired, depending on grazing pulses etc[^13_regen-9].

-   Rainforest and other areas with important lower plant assemblages[^13_regen-10] : more emphasises needed on when there is "too much"[^13_regen-11]

-   Woodland creation sites: There may be no seed sources[^13_regen-12], lower importance when planting, greater importance when relying on natural colonisation[^13_regen-13]

[^13_regen-9]: \[\[Chris Reid\]\]

[^13_regen-10]: \[\[Kylie Jones Mattock\]\]

[^13_regen-11]: \[\[Ewan McHenry\]\]

[^13_regen-12]: \[\[Ian Moss\]\]

[^13_regen-13]: \[\[Ewan McHenry\]\]

Spatial scale: Regen it important at site, but not nessesarily at plot-scale[^13_regen-14]. Its ok to have no regen in an individual plot, as long as it is elsewhere

[^13_regen-14]: \[\[Dave Bonsall\]\]

Closed canopy[^13_regen-15]

[^13_regen-15]: \[\[Dave Bonsall\]\]

> Or is lack of regen just a sign of reduced quality here?

### Lower priority exceptions

Temporal patchiness:

-   Can be sporadic, and often is[^13_regen-16], may be desirable in "Pulses"[^13_regen-17].

-   Can be ephemeral because of grazing (slugs, deer etc)[^13_regen-18]:

    -   Absence within plot-visit doesn't mean no successful recruitment over e.g. next 5 years.

    -   Presence in e.g. A spring survey, doesn't garentee survival in 2 months

-   Needs a long-term view. Regen not needed constantly to ensure good condition[^13_regen-19]

[^13_regen-16]: \[\[Alasdair Firth\]\]

[^13_regen-17]: \[\[Jim Smith-Wright\]\], \[\[Louise Hackett\]\]

[^13_regen-18]: Peter Lowe

[^13_regen-19]: \[\[Liam Plummer\]\]

More important when existing trees are dying[^13_regen-20]

[^13_regen-20]: \[\[Peter Lowe\]\]

> Could be indicated by Tree health and Tree Size Distribution indicators

Coppice[^13_regen-21]

[^13_regen-21]: \[\[Dave Bonsall\]\]

Availability of seed source[^13_regen-22]

### Concerns already covered by this or other indicators

# Other approaches

## Woodland Wildlife Toolkit 

Value 1: no regen present

Value 2: 1 - 2 regen classes present

Value 3: three regen classes present

## NFI

At 1 ha square level, and component

-   ComponentS: Saplings and seedlings Detection/non-detection

-   10 m transect per woodland section: 1m wide for seedlings, 2m wide for saplings, grouped by species -

-   Circular plots: Young trees in circular plots

Favourable: 3 regen classes present

Intermediate: 1 - 2 regen classes present (also includes 0 regen at component-level)

Unfavorable: only when no regen in 1 ha

## Current WT estate condition assessment

DAFOR for each regeneration class for native and non-native trees and shrubs separately.
