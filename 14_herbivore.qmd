# Herbivore Impact

## **Note to round 2 respondents**

**Since round 1, this indicator has been completly revised. Your initial responses have had to be discarded.**

## Justification

High herbivore impact is damaging for most woods[^14_herbivore-1]. This indicator aims to capture this damage, with positive impacts of herbivory coming from other indicators ([horizontal complexity](17_horizontal-complexity.qmd) etc).

## Measuring

> Note: The following has been developed and trialed by Ewan McHenry, Alasdair Firth and Peter Lowe.

If a herbivore impact assessment (LITE or full) has been carried out in the past 2 years, this will not be required, and the information can be taken from that survey.

**Herbivore Impact Assessment SUPERLITE**:

-   A 3 min (timed) HIA

-   Focusing on saplings (0.05 - 2 m), basal shoots (\<2m) and vascular plants.

-   Estimate the percentage of the last 12 months potential growth removed by herbivory

-   For palatable and unpalatable species separately.

    -   Unpalatable species: Sitka, hard conifers, birch and alder

Notes

-   Focus on canopy gaps, edge etc, within or close to plot (more potential for saplings), avoid herbivore-inaccessible parts (e.g. Cliff edges). Extend beyond plot if required

-   Do not consider historic browsing \> 12 months ago

-   May help to tally frequency of different herbivory levels by tree/plant species

-   This indicator focuses on the negative aspects of herbivory, the positive aspects of appropriate levels should be captured by other indicators (e.g. horizontal complexity), although where herbivory is absent this should be noted and may provide an early warning of an issue requiring management.

Tick boxes on: - Visible browse line - Poaching/trampling - Significant deer trails - Fenced status, with note on extent at site

Notes on status of fence, type of grazer, grazing history (if known) etc.

## Calculating condition score (will be automatic)

![Herbivory measurement will be used to categorise the level of herbivore impact. Condition score will relate to this category (using the value function)](images/Herbivore%20Imapct%202023-11-06%2016.22.12.excalidraw.png){width="500"}

# Respondent value functions and weights

Given the change in measurement method, the previous estimates for value functions are not informative. An initial estimate has been provided by Alasdair Firth:

| Herbivory category | Condition score |
|--------------------|-----------------|
| 0                  | 0               |
| 1                  | 15              |
| 2                  | 30              |
| 3                  | 80              |
| 4                  | 100             |

# Respondent comments

### Considerations for indicator design

Should be tested on sites across the herbivory impact gradient

Will require training: video with e.g. clips from different seasons would be useful

Seasonality

-   Bracken can obscure browse line

-   Herbivore impact is very patchy in summer, largest impacts happen in winter, when food supply is limited

-   Summer assessment of this years growth + part of last year's is difficult. Easiest in March - April, before bud-burst,

    -   But then other indicators e.g. Ground Flora will be more difficult

### Priority exceptions

Woodland types

-   Woodland creation sites: more important[^14_herbivore-2]

-   Open woodland types: Tension where grazing and browsing is a key component of the habitat. Need to encourage appropriate amount of grazing, not encourage continual reduction as associated increases in tree regeneration[^14_herbivore-3].

-   Upland oak woodlands[^14_herbivore-4]

[^14_herbivore-2]: Liam Plummer

[^14_herbivore-3]: Saul Herbert, Richard Brown, Kylie Jones Mattock, Jim Smith-Wright, David Venables, Nick Reed-Beale

[^14_herbivore-4]: Kylie Jones Mattock

> Follow up: is herbivore impact thought to be worse here or less impactful?

Spatially patchy[^14_herbivore-5]: often concentrated to the best parts of woodland. Even if it is just these high value areas that are affected , condition should be low[^14_herbivore-6]

[^14_herbivore-5]: Louise Hackett

[^14_herbivore-6]: Hannah Patterson

Should also capture grey squirrel bark stripping.

### Lower priority exceptions

Pulses of herbivory may be beneficial[^14_herbivore-7]

[^14_herbivore-7]: Jim Smith-Wright

Intermittent heavy browsing could aid veteranisation

> *Is there evidence for this?*

Quality of grazing available may impact holding capacity of the land: as e.g. restoration and creation improves grazing quality, impact may increase[^14_herbivore-8]

[^14_herbivore-8]: Peter Lowe

Landscapes with no herbivore impacts[^14_herbivore-9]

[^14_herbivore-9]: Bob Epsom

> Could have lower importance here

### Concerns already covered by this or other indicators

Rainforest etc: zero browsing very detrimental to saprophytic and lichen biodiversity[^14_herbivore-10]

[^14_herbivore-10]: Oliver Moore, Daniel Aitken

> Any potentially negative impacts of too little browsing should be captured with other attributes, e.g. Ground flora, canopy cover, age structure, Vertical Structure. However, zero herbivory will be an early-warning for this, so should be recorded.
>
> -   [ ] follow up with Oliver Moore

Need to include boar/feral pig impact[^14_herbivore-11]

[^14_herbivore-11]: Richard Brown

> Dealt with by trampling/poaching notes?

Trampling may be quickest to change following management

Type of browser is important: Sheep can be very bad (non-native, selective), cattle at right density can be good[^14_herbivore-12]

[^14_herbivore-12]: Martin Hugi

> Added notes to allow this to be recorded

History of browsing may be relevant and should be recorded where possible

## NFI WEC

Favorable: No significant herbivore damage in woodland

Intermediate: Herbivore damage in wood, but not in plot (or only squirrel damage in plot)

Unfavorable: Herbivore damage in plots

## Current WT estate condition assessment
