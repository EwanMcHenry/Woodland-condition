# Tree health

## Justification

Tree disease threatens the resilience of woodlands, locally and at landscape scale.

## Measuring

Record detection/non-detection of high risk and low risk (separately) pests and diseases.

Record percentage of basal area tree mortality and notable crown dieback

Should be recorded separately in non-natives and invasive plants

Condition score of 0 if high-risk pest/disease is present,

### Comments on data

VFs:

-   A lot of variation

> Refer to [Woodland Wildlife Toolkit] approach when reviewing

# Respondent comments

### Considerations for indicator design

Measuring basal area is a relatively tedious desk job, difficult to do quickly in the field. Suggest DAFOR instead[^15_tree-heath-1].

[^15_tree-heath-1]: Richard Brown

> They are quire broad basal area categories, high precision may not be necessary.
>
> Note: NFI WEC measures all tree diameters in the 10m plot, and dead/living status, allowing basal area and % mortality to be calculated automatically.

### Priority exceptions

Landscape - e.g. ash dieback on chalk[^15_tree-heath-2].

[^15_tree-heath-2]: Dave Bonsall

> -   [ ] Follow up; unsure what is meant here[^15_tree-heath-3].

[^15_tree-heath-3]: Ewan McHenry

Landscapes susceptible to outbreak, where affected species abundant (ash, chestnut)[^15_tree-heath-4]

[^15_tree-heath-4]: Bob Epsom

### Lower priority exceptions

### Concerns already covered by this or other indicators

Low amounts could break up a single-species stand to increase structural complexity[^15_tree-heath-5]

[^15_tree-heath-5]: Dave Bonsall, David Venables

> This may be best dealt with via indicators that directly capture those aspects (e.g. [Horizontal complexity](17_horizontal-complexity.qmd)).

Potential conflict with deadwood[^15_tree-heath-6] and nutrient cycling[^15_tree-heath-7]. Tree mortality may be particularly important where deadwood is scarce[^15_tree-heath-8]

[^15_tree-heath-6]: Richard Brown, Kylie Jones Mattock, David Venables

[^15_tree-heath-7]: Jim Smith-Wright

[^15_tree-heath-8]: Kylie Jones Mattock

> This should probably be dealt with independently using the deadwood indicator.

Interaction with Native Tree and Shrub Species Richness(N):

-   a little bit of disease could be good to break up single species stands[^15_tree-heath-9]

[^15_tree-heath-9]: Dave Bonsall

> May be best covered with e.g. Vertical Structure and other indicators.

-   A diverse wood will be more resilient to disease[^15_tree-heath-10], less important with higher species diversity[^15_tree-heath-11]

[^15_tree-heath-10]: Liam Plummer, Jim Smith-Wright, Martin Hugi

[^15_tree-heath-11]: Hannah Patterson, Ian Moss, Martin Hugi

> It would be expected to score better for this indicator then (as it is expected to have less % of disease). But could consider lowering importance with increasing tree SR.

Disease in e.g. Invasives and non-native over-canopy may be good[^15_tree-heath-12], but may require notification.

[^15_tree-heath-12]: Kylie Jones Mattock

> Should be record separately, but have no impact on ecological condition

Will depend on virulence and specificity of the pest/pathogen[^15_tree-heath-13]

[^15_tree-heath-13]: Ian Moss

> Pathogen risk level is recorded and affects scoring

# Other approaches

## Woodland Wildlife Toolkit {sec-wwt_health=""}

Value 3: Rapid mortality in \<10% of basal area AND no pests or diseases AND no crown dieback

Value 2: 10-25% basal area rapid mortality

-   OR 0-10% with crown dieback/ low risk pests/disease

Value 1: 25- 100% rapid mortality of basal area

-   OR presence of high risk pest/disease

-   OR 10-25% basal area rapid mortality AND low risk pests/disease

## NFI

## Current WT estate condition assessment

DAFOR notable and other pests/diseases

-   Noted to work very well[^15_tree-heath-14]

[^15_tree-heath-14]: Richard Brown

> Should consider DOMIN instead of DAFOR
