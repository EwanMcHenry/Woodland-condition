# Tree health

## Note to round 2 respondents

Review [Woodland Wildlife Toolkit] approach for context.

## Justification

Tree disease threatens the resilience of woodlands, locally and at landscape scale.

## Measuring

Record detection/non-detection of high risk and low risk (separately) pests and diseases.

Record percentage of basal area tree mortality and notable crown dieback

Note if non-natives and invasive plants are only ones affected[^15_tree-heath-1].

# Respondent comments

### Considerations for indicator design

Measuring basal area is a relatively tedious desk job, difficult to do quickly in the field. Suggest DAFOR instead[^15_tree-heath-2].

[^15_tree-heath-2]: Richard Brown

> They are quire broad basal area categories, high precision may not be necessary.
>
> Note: NFI WEC measures all tree diameters in the 10m plot, and dead/living status, allowing basal area and % mortality to be calculated automatically.

### Priority exceptions

Landscape - e.g. ash dieback on chalk[^15_tree-heath-3].

[^15_tree-heath-3]: Dave Bonsall

> -   [ ] Follow up; unsure what is meant here.

Landscapes susceptible to outbreak, where affected species abundant (ash, chestnut)[^15_tree-heath-4]

[^15_tree-heath-4]: Bob Epsom

### Lower priority exceptions

### Concerns already covered by this or other indicators

Low amounts could break up a single-species stand to increase structural complexity[^15_tree-heath-5]

[^15_tree-heath-5]: Dave Bonsall, David Venables

> This may be best dealt with via indicators that directly capture those aspects (e.g. [Horizontal complexity](17_horizontal-complexity.qmd)).

Potential conflict with deadwood[^15_tree-heath-6] and nutrient cycling[^15_tree-heath-7]. Tree mortality may be particularly important where deadwood is scarce[^15_tree-heath-8]

[^15_tree-heath-6]: Richard Brown, Kylie Jones Mattock, David Venables

[^15_tree-heath-7]: Jim Smith-Wright

[^15_tree-heath-8]: Kylie Jones Mattock

> This should probably be dealt with independently using the deadwood indicator.

Interaction with Native Tree and Shrub Species Richness(N), a little bit of disease could be good to break up single species stands[^15_tree-heath-9]. Diverse woods will be more resilient to disease[^15_tree-heath-10], less important with higher species diversity[^15_tree-heath-11]

[^15_tree-heath-9]: Dave Bonsall

[^15_tree-heath-10]: Liam Plummer, Jim Smith-Wright, Martin Hugi

[^15_tree-heath-11]: Hannah Patterson, Ian Moss, Martin Hugi

> May be best covered with e.g. Vertical Structure and other indicators.
>
> More diverse expected to score better for this indicator, but exception maybe not needed. Could consider lowering importance with increasing tree SR.

Will depend on virulence and specificity of the pest/pathogen[^15_tree-heath-12]

> Pathogen risk level is recorded and affects scoring

# Other approaches

## Woodland Wildlife Toolkit {sec-wwt_health=""}

Value 3: Rapid mortality in \<10% of basal area AND no pests or diseases AND no crown dieback

Value 2: 10-25% basal area rapid mortality

-   OR 0-10% with crown dieback/ low risk pests/disease

Value 1: 25- 100% rapid mortality of basal area

-   OR presence of high risk pest/disease

-   OR 10-25% basal area rapid mortality AND low risk pests/disease

## NFI

## Current WT estate condition assessment

DAFOR notable and other pests/diseases

-   Noted to work very well[^15_tree-heath-13]

[^15_tree-heath-13]: Richard Brown

> Should consider DOMIN instead of DAFOR
