# Horizontal complexity

## Justification

Wood of different height, including some open habitat, provide more complementary resources and niche space, benefiting biodiversity.

## Measuring

Straight transect from plot, in direction of next plot (c. 200m suggested), recording top height (or top height category) at stopping points (every 20m suggested).

> Alternative 1: Condition relates to the number of different heights
>
> Alternative 2: Condition relates to a height-band diversity metric (e.g. [Shannon Index](https://www.statology.org/shannon-diversity-index/){.uri})

Using same height bands as [vertical structure](07_vert_struct.qmd).

# Respondent comments

### Considerations for indicator design

Difficult/impossible/dangerous in rough terrain

Transect is another "Thing to do" that makes the process more taxing[^17_horizontal-complexity-1]

[^17_horizontal-complexity-1]: Richard Brown

200m could easily lead out of a woodland[^17_horizontal-complexity-2]

[^17_horizontal-complexity-2]: Richard Brown

Might be an unrepresentative direction, possibly going through a strangely uniform stand, or along a linear, uniform features like a rides[^17_horizontal-complexity-3]

[^17_horizontal-complexity-3]: Richard Brown, David Venables

> Random is the best insurance against bias, but we could allow the picking of another random direction if the initial one was "obviously unrepresentative"[^17_horizontal-complexity-4]. *It does allow bias to creep in though...*

[^17_horizontal-complexity-4]: Ewan McHenry

In the future will likely be measured as some Vertical complexity Index using remote sensing data. But for now, we need a field based method. Will also need both types of data to be collected for a time to allow calibration.

Feeling that this is a messy addition, particularly when other indicators assess diversity of structure[^17_horizontal-complexity-5].

[^17_horizontal-complexity-5]: Richard Brown

> True, but the scale of this one is different (goes beyond plot).

### Priority exceptions

Woodland type

-   Younger woodlands[^17_horizontal-complexity-6]

[^17_horizontal-complexity-6]: Hannah Patterson, David Logan

> Could either use different top height categories, or calculate slightly differently[^17_horizontal-complexity-7].
>
> Note that e.g. an older wood could well only have 1-2 top height classes as well. A well designed woodland creation site should be able to compete.
>
> Could work well for woodland creation (perhaps with adaptation), as it can be an indicator of good design[^17_horizontal-complexity-8].

[^17_horizontal-complexity-7]: Ewan McHenry

[^17_horizontal-complexity-8]: Saul Herbert

-   Wood pasture: Likely to have much more open habitat, may score low as a result, but be in "Good" condition[^17_horizontal-complexity-9]

[^17_horizontal-complexity-9]: Liam Plummer, Ian Moss, Louise Hackett

> Might consider longer transect, with wider spacing in some appropriate habitat types?

-   Upland woods[^17_horizontal-complexity-10]

-   Scrub - can have a lot of structure, but not captured by this top-height variation[^17_horizontal-complexity-11]

-   Hazel woods[^17_horizontal-complexity-12]

-   Active short rotation coppice[^17_horizontal-complexity-13]

[^17_horizontal-complexity-10]: Ian Moss, Louise Hackett

[^17_horizontal-complexity-11]: Jim Smith-Wright

[^17_horizontal-complexity-12]: Louise Hackett

[^17_horizontal-complexity-13]: Bob Epsom

Landscape context[^17_horizontal-complexity-14]:

[^17_horizontal-complexity-14]: David Venables

-   Site- level horizontal complexity may be less important where that variability is at larger scale[^17_horizontal-complexity-15]. A homogeneous high canopy wood within a diverse landscape could be OK.

[^17_horizontal-complexity-15]: Liam Plummer

### Lower priority exceptions

Danger that this could drive extreme and weird management, or maybe some great ones[^17_horizontal-complexity-16]

[^17_horizontal-complexity-16]: Saul Herbert

Smaller woods may accept less variation[^17_horizontal-complexity-17]

[^17_horizontal-complexity-17]: Jim Smith-Wright

> -   [ ] Follow up: Not sure why this might be the case

Commercial forestry[^17_horizontal-complexity-18]

[^17_horizontal-complexity-18]: Kylie Jones Mattock

> Would just score poorly - trade off between ecological condition and commercial management objectives

UKWAS certification requires 20% "Open space"[^17_horizontal-complexity-19], need to allow measurement of this, either as well as or separately to this indicator

[^17_horizontal-complexity-19]: Richard Brown

Woodland in transition, perhaps due to management[^17_horizontal-complexity-20]

[^17_horizontal-complexity-20]: David Venables

### Concerns already covered by this or other indicators

Small woods may have less variation[^17_horizontal-complexity-21]

[^17_horizontal-complexity-21]: Karen Hornigold

> May just score poorly, if low variation. May prompt management considerations

# Other approaches

## Woodland Wildlife Toolkit

"Open Space": Note areas of open habitat during woodland walk highlight areas using aerial photographs (visiting where confirmation is required).

-   Temporary open space, where trees can be expected to regenerate.

-   At least 10m wide and \< 20% canopy cover.

Transitions should be graded ecotones.
