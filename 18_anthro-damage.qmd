# Human damage

## Justification

High pollution reduces species diversity and natural processes[^18_anthro-damage-1]

[^18_anthro-damage-1]: Alasdair Firth

## Measuring

This indicator requires significant development

Attempting to capture:

::: two-columns
-   Anthropogenic damage

-   Soil damage

-   Compaction, erosion

-   Farming spill over: fertiliser, spraying & pesticide

-   Livestock feeding in wood with potential to cause damage

-   Dumping

-   N+ indicator plants
:::

May be better to separate out damage based on spatial scale, intensity and permanence.

### Comments on data

VFs: Big range, but may converge to a consensus.

-   Recommend refering to the [Woodland Wildlife Toolkit] methods to contextualize

Weights:

-   Full range

# Respondent comments

### Considerations for indicator design

Fertilizer spraying and wash-off from adjacent land not always obvious[^18_anthro-damage-2]

[^18_anthro-damage-2]: Richard Brown

May require soil/water samples

Should the source of damage be identified and recorded?

-   Impacts may be subtle and take years to develop

### Priority exceptions

Depends a lot on type of damage[^18_anthro-damage-3], some human impacts not nessesarily negative[^18_anthro-damage-4]

[^18_anthro-damage-3]: Jim Smith-Wright, Hannah Patterson, Ian Moss, Martin Hugi, Louise Hackett

[^18_anthro-damage-4]: Kylie Jones Mattock

Nutrient enrichment indicator plants may indicate land use before planting, not ongoing threat. E.g. Planting on arable field[^18_anthro-damage-5]

[^18_anthro-damage-5]: Richard Brown

Ongoing/one-off/accumulating instances[^18_anthro-damage-6]

[^18_anthro-damage-6]: Hannah Patterson, Louise Hackett

Edge may be affected more[^18_anthro-damage-7]

[^18_anthro-damage-7]: Alasdair Firth

Onsite vs offsite sources

"Damage" caused by woodland management operations that benefit long term conservation objectives[^18_anthro-damage-8].

[^18_anthro-damage-8]: Louise Hackett

OPAL has produced info to help nitrogen-loving lichen ID as part of their [Air Quality Monitoring](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/research-centres-and-groups/opal/AIR-16pp-booklet_legacy.pdf)

### Lower priority exceptions

Amenity woodland

Commercial objectives[^18_anthro-damage-9]

[^18_anthro-damage-9]: Kylie Jones Mattock

Secondary woodlands[^18_anthro-damage-10]

[^18_anthro-damage-10]: Kylie Jones Mattock

Soil disturbance may be good for natural regeneration[^18_anthro-damage-11] and ecological functioning

[^18_anthro-damage-11]: Ian Moss

### Concerns already covered by this or other indicators

# Other approaches

## Woodland Wildlife Toolkit

On woodland walk, record evidence of nutrient enrichment and/or damaged ground, including patches of nettle and/or goose grass/cleavers (nutrient enrichment indicator) \>0.1 ha

-   Favourable: No nutrient enrichment or damaged ground

-   Intermediate: \< 1 ha total nutrient enrichment and/or \< 20% damaged soil

-   Poor: \> 1 ha total nutrient enrichment and/or \> 20% damaged soil

> Note: the bigger the woodland, the more likley that damage/enrichment will be found and be \> 1 ha, purely because a larger area is searched. This would be better expressed as a % of the wood.
>
> Note: "and/or" wording in poor class is ambiguous. shoudl be "or"

Note soil damage: - Deep ruts - Excessive/continuous compaction

## Current WT estate condition assessment

Human impacts, split by one off/continuous
