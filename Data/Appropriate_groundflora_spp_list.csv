"Fern, polypody sp.",Polypodium sp.,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,,,"Not in TSH. Indicator of old woodland continuity and natural woodland edges, typical of ancient, rocky and undisturbed woodlands. Species are often hard to separate in the field and have similar ecological roles so grouped under 'sp.'"
"Fern, royal",Osmunda regalis ,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,"Strongly associated with constantly damp, acidic, nutrient-poor conditions.Typically found in wet woodland (especially alder carr), wooded valley mires, stream edges, flushes, and wet heath–woodland transitions.

Moschatel,Adoxa moschatellina,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,,,"In TSH only listed in WU and WL, but whilst it does favour damper soils, it doesn't tolerate waterlogging. It is associated with base-rich woodlands W8 in lowlands and W9 in the uplands, and is fairly widespread across the UK."
Moss sp.,,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,,"Difficult to ID to genus and species for the general practitioner. Included in species list so that a DOMIN score can be given to indicate over dominance. Some mosses are valuable indicators, others are disturbance-tolerant and competitive, and many are ambiguous or low diagnostic value. "
Nettle,Urtica dioica,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,,"It is in TSH lists for WU and WL, and although it is valaubale as a food plant it ishighly indicative of disturbance and eutophication. Excluded as a ecological indicator. Useful to capture it, and it's DOMIN though, especially as it is so recognisable and easy to see across a plot."
Nettle-leaved bellflower,Campanula trachelium,,,,,,,,,
Old man's beard (Clematis alba),Clematis vitalba,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,,"Can be 'invasive' if over dominant, but a good for woodland structure. In the TSH in BRL"
