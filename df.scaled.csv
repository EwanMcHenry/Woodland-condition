The really bad laurel and rhodi sites are where it has totally overtaken the understorey, if there are a few scattered bushes its not bad, as long as the managment plan mentions control. If there's presence but no plan...this can be a problem as the site is on the road to total take over.

Assessment would be better based around assessment of tree life classes i.e. along the lines of seedling, sapling, young, mature, over-mature, sencescent, dead. In simplest terms, woods with old trees have more value. More old trees isn't necessarily better - if the whole wood is old, then where is the space for the young trees? Perhaps the ideal number is enough to fit in some other mature or aging trees. 8 in a ha is a complete guess through.

However, non-native trees can still provide ecosystem functions as long as they don't interfere with the life cycle of native trees/shrubs, they would be more likely to do this if they are casting lots of shade and seeding everywhere. However, non-native trees could provide a positive function to certain extent in the lower canopy if they are keeping course vegetation (bramble, bracken) from becoming dominant.

This succession is dependent on trees being able to seed and spread seed into the soil and for the seed to grow in the right conditions, if we have native trees and shrubs in all canopy layers then there's a likelihood succession will happen in the optimum conditions. However, non-native trees can still provide ecosystem functions as long as they don't interfere with the life cycle of native trees/shrubs, they would be more likely to do this if they are casting lots of shade and seeding everywhere. However, non-native trees could provide a positive function to certain extent in the lower canopy if they are keeping course vegetation (bramble, bracken) from becoming dominant. Good condition is more dependent therefore on a higher % of native trees in the upper canopy in dominant positions and the chance to spread seed and to provide the important habitat niches that large diameter broadleaves provide.",90,5,"Native canopy percentage ","Canopy nativeness (all layers)","Native canopy trees (% of canopy)"

"1988","Vertical structure: Number of tree and shrub canopy layers present","Alasdair Fi",3,1,0,"3","This is all very subjective. In many 'natural' woodland contexts (at least in Scotland) its hard/impossible to separate different canpoy layers (unless perhaps you select a plot where there are clear canopy layers!). in any case, with only native species present, often two canopy layers (or a single blended canopy layer, depending on how you look at it) is the maximum possible. Above this, if you have introduced conifers or poplars present there may be more canopy layers, but that's not necessarily positive and is as likely to reflect things other than natural woodland dynamics.",0,NA,"Vertical structure","Vertical structure","Number of canopy layers"
